The famous Monokai theme, now available for SuperCollider IDE at the low price of $0.

`sc_ide_conf.yaml` is for the editor. There is no easy way to install this; it has to be manually grafted into `Platform.userConfigDir +/+ "sc_ide_conf.yaml"`. It goes under IDE/editor.

`scdoc.css` is for the help files.
